//! Peano integers
//!
//! Peano integers are a specialized kind of integers, that allow to increase the integer
//! without checking for overflows.
//!
//! See <https://inria.hal.science/hal-01162661v1> for reference.
//!
//! # Usage in data structures
//!
//! They are useful when specyfying a data structure, where
//! - Checking for overflows of the length is hard (and may leak to the users of the library)
//! - Overflows are impossible, because objects are always created one-by-one.
//!
//! In this case, you could use a [`PeanoInt`] to store the length.
//!
//! # Why not always use them ?
//!
//! Well, simply because you cannot add two peano integers together, at least not
//! efficiently. if you need to do usual arithmetic operations, you should use a normal
//! integer.
//!
//! # Ghost code
//!
//! You cannot increase a peano integer in [ghost](macro@crate::ghost) code, as it may
//! overflow the backing integer. Since ghost code is not executed, the time argument is
//! not applicable.
