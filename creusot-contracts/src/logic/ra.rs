/// Define a _Resource Algebra_.
///
/// Resource algebras are a concept inspired by [Iris](https://iris-project.org/). Used in
/// conjunction with [`Resource`](crate::resource::Resource)s, they unlock new reasonings.
///
/// # Notes on the definition of resource algebras
///
/// Our definition of resource algebras differs from the one in Iris in that it
/// does not require RAs to define a "core" function. Instead, we follow "Idempotent
/// Resources in Separation Logic --- The Heart of core in Iris" by Gratzer, MÃ¸ller &
/// Birkedal (GMB), and require RAs to satisfy a "maximal idempotent" axiom.
pub trait RA: Sized {
    /// The operation of this resource algebra.
    ///
    /// This is the core of the trait. This operation will be used to [`join`](crate::resource::Resource::join)
    /// and [`split`](crate::resource::Resource::split) resources.
    ///
    /// It must be [associative](Self::associative) and [commutative](Self::commutative)
    /// (among others).

    // Derived notions: `factor`, `incl`, `idemp`.
    // We allow the implementor to give a custom definition, that is possibly
    // simpler than the generic one. The custom definition is the one that
    // will be used to prove the RA laws.

    /// Factorizing elements of the RA
    ///
    /// Given `a` and `c`, this returns an element `b` such that `a = b.c`,
    /// or returns `None` if there does not exists such an element.

    /// Inclusion of RA.
    ///
    /// This asserts that `other` is, in a sense, 'bigger' than `self`.
    ///
    /// # Notes on reflexivity
    ///
    /// Following Iris, our definition of `incl` is not reflexive.
    /// We could define it to be `self == other || ...`, but doing that
    /// loses the following desirable property for the product RA:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// (x, y).incl((x', y')) == x.incl(x') && y.incl(y').
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If you need the reflexive closure of the inclusion relation, then
    /// you can use `Some(x).incl(Some(y))`. Indeed, `incl` on the Option RA
    /// has the following property:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Some(x).incl(Some(y)) == (x == y || x.incl(y))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that the paper on the maximal idempotent axiom (GMB) uses the
    /// reflexive definition of `incl` on paper, but not in its accompanying
    /// Iris formalization, where it uses the non-reflexive definition (as
    /// we do here).
