# Known limitations

Formal verification provides strong guarantees about your code.
Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the limits of what one has specified.
Creusot users should take note of the following limitations.

## Some panics are allowed

The `Vec` methods that increase capacity (`push`, `insert`, `extend`, etc.)
panic if the capacity overflows. The current contracts in `creusot-contracts`
do not prevent this.

Because `Vec` is such a fundamental type, bounding
its length is quite cumbersome. Moreover, you will probably run out of memory
(another kind of failure that Creusot does not prevent) before the capacity overflows.
There remains one notable blind spot: a `Vec` of a zero-sized type enables
triggering this panic quite easily.

## Architecture specificity

Creusot compiles code for some given target architecture,
so the resulting proofs are only valid for that architecture.

An important consequence is that the sizes of many types
are constants which depend on the architecture or compiler optimizations.
In particular, this affects the value of `usize::MAX` and the sizes of
`repr(Rust)` types. The latter are technically unspecified by
[The Rust Reference: Type Layout][rust-layout].

## vec! macro

The vec! macro of Rust's standard library uses special magic to initialize memory slightly more
efficiently. Creusot does not support this magic, hence the version provided by the standard library
is not supported in Creusot.

Instead, we provide the replacement macro `creusot_contracts::std::vec::vec`, which has the same
semantics and can be used in Creusot, albeit being slightly less efficient (the content of the
vector is first allocated in the stack, and then moved to the newly allocated vector, instead of
being directly initialized in the heap). It needs to be explicitly imported in order to not conflict
with Rust's default implementation.
